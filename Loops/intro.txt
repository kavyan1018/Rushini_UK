there is total 2 types of loops in python

1) entry controlled loop

    : for loop
    : while loop

for -> when we know the no of iterations in advance

    : do while loop

i = 0;  -->  initialization
i < 5;  -->  condition
i++;    -->  increment/decrement

// in c lang.
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d", i);
}


range() function:
