# Array in python
# Array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
# The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.
# This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
#   Array can be handled in python by a module named array. They can be useful when we have to manipulate only a specific data type values.
#   A user can treat lists as arrays. However, user cannot constraint the type of elements stored in a list. If you create arrays using the array module, all elements of the array must be of the same type.
