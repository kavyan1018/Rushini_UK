Definition of Hardware
-----------------------

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system that you can touch and see. 

These components include:

input devices : (keyboard, mouse, scanner)
output devices : (monitor, printer, speakers)
internal components : (CPU, RAM, hard drive, mother board)

CPU : Central Processing Unit
RAM : Random Access Memory



Definition of Software
-------------------------

Software is the set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. It is intangible and cannot be touched or seen.

System software : (operating system, device drivers)
operating system : (Windows, Mac OS, Linux) which is manage the hardware resources

Application software : Program designed for users to perform specific tasks. (Word, Excel, Photoshop)



Relationship Between Hardware and Software
--------------------------------------------

Dependence: Hardware and software are interdependent. Hardware cannot function without software to tell it what to do, and software cannot operate without the physical resources provided by hardware.


Interaction: Software sends instructions to the hardware. For example, when you run a program, the software communicates with the CPU to perform computations, RAM to store temporary data, and storage drives to save files.

u type code in vs --> it is software
u see the output in monitor --> it is hardware
internal process of computer system --> vs code -> cpu(binarry code) -> ram -> hard drive -> mother board -> monitor

Examples:
A printer (hardware) needs printer driver software to understand and execute the commands sent by a computer.
The CPU executes instructions from system software like the operating system to manage resources like memory and storage.


2. Logic Gates and Truth Tables including combined logic gates 


Logic Gates
------------
Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions based on Boolean algebra. There are seven basic logic gates:


AND Gate: Output is true only if all inputs are true.
OR Gate: Output is true if any input is true.
NOT Gate: Output is the opposite of the input.
XOR Gate: Output is true if exactly one input is true.

Examples : 

take input from usear and cheak the number is divisible by 3 and 11 or not   -> And gate  &&
take input from user and cheak the number is even or odd   -> Or gate  ||
take input from user and cheak the number is positive or negative   -> Not gate  !
take input from user and cheak the number is prime or not   -> Xor gate  ^


3.Software classifcation

Software Classification
-------------------------
Software can be classified into two main categories: 
system software 
application software.

System Software
----------------
System software is designed to manage the hardware resources of a computer system. It provides a platform for running application software and interacts with the hardware to perform tasks. Examples of system software include:

Operating Systems: Manage hardware resources and provide a user interface for interacting with the computer. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Device Drivers: Control specific hardware devices like printers, scanners, and graphics cards.
Utilities: Perform maintenance tasks like disk cleanup, antivirus scanning, and system optimization.

Application Software
----------------------
Application software is designed to perform specific tasks for users. It is created to meet the needs of individuals, businesses, and organizations. Examples of application software include:

Word Processing Software: Create, edit, and format text documents. Examples include Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and LibreOffice Writer.
Spreadsheet Software: Organize and analyze data in tabular form. Examples include Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and LibreOffice Calc.
Graphics Software: Create and edit images, illustrations, and animations. Examples include Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, and CorelDRAW.
Database Software: Store, retrieve, and manage data in a structured format. Examples include Microsoft Access, MySQL, and Oracle Database.



4. Classifcation of programming languages and translators

Programming Languages
-----------------------
Programming languages are used to write instructions that tell a computer how to perform tasks. They are designed to be human-readable and are translated into machine code for execution. Programming languages can be classified into several categories based on their characteristics and features:

Low-Level Languages: These languages are close to machine code and provide direct control over hardware resources. Examples include Assembly language and machine code.

High-Level Languages: These languages are closer to human language and are easier to read and write. They are more abstract and provide higher-level constructs for programming. Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.

Systems architecture :

1. Genral Prinicples of Computer Architecture
2. specific architecture patterns (Ex. microservices, serverless, event-driven)
3. Enterprise architecture
4. Cloud architecture
5. Security architecture
6. Network architecture
7. A perticular architecture stack of framworking

Von Neumann
architecture:
• arithmetic logic unit
• control unit
• clock
• register
• bus.


1. architecture logic unit : perform arithmetic and logical operations

arithmetic operations : addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
logical operations : AND, OR, NOT, XOR


2. control unit : manage the execution of instructions and data flow within the CPU
fetch : get the instruction from memory
decode : interpret the instruction
execute : perform the operation
store : save the result back to memory


3. clock : synchronize the operations of the CPU and other components of the computer system


4. register : temporary storage locations within the CPU for data and instructions
accumulator : store the result of arithmetic and logical operations
program counter : keep track of the memory address of the next instruction to


5. bus : communication channels that transfer data between components of the computer system
data bus : transfer data between the CPU, memory, and other devices
address bus : specify the memory address for read and write operations
control bus : carry control signals for coordinating data transfer


Explain the effect of the following on the performance of the CPU:
• clock speed
• number of processor cores
• cache size.

1. Clock Speed: The clock speed of a CPU determines how many instructions it can execute per second. A higher clock speed means the CPU can process more instructions in a given time, leading to faster performance. However, increasing the clock speed also generates more heat and consumes more power, which can affect the overall efficiency and reliability of the CPU.

What is the meaning of determines  ?
-> decide or control the outcome or result of something


2. number of processor cores: The number of processor cores in a CPU determines how many tasks it can handle same time. Each core can execute instructions independently, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance. A CPU with more cores can run multiple programs or processes concurrently, leading to faster response times and better multitasking capabilities.


What is the meaning of simultaneously ?
-> at the same time

types of processor ?
-> single-core processor
-> dual-core processor
-> quad-core processor
-> octa-core processor

Fetch
Decode
Execute
Store

Understand and explain the Fetch-Execute cycle.
---------------------------------------------------

The Fetch-Execute cycle is the basic operation of a CPU that executes instructions stored in memory. It consists of two main steps:



1. Fetch: The CPU retrieves the next instruction from memory using the program counter, which stores the memory address of the instruction. The instruction is loaded into the instruction register for decoding and execution.


2 . Execute: The CPU decodes the instruction to determine the operation to be performed and the operands involved. It then executes the instruction by performing the specified operation, such as arithmetic, logical, or data transfer. The result is stored in the appropriate register or memory location.


3. Decode : The CPU interprets the instruction to determine the operation to be performed and the data involved. It decodes the instruction to understand the operation and the operands.

examle : Char -> Decimal Value -> Binary Value

4. Store : The CPU saves the result of the executed instruction back to memory or a register for future use. The result may be stored in the accumulator, a general-purpose register, or a specific memory location.

Understand the different types of memory within a computer:
• RAM
• ROM
• Cache
• Register

1. RAM (Random Access Memory): RAM is a type of volatile memory that stores data and instructions temporarily while the computer is running. It is used to store the operating system, applications, and data that are actively being used by the CPU. RAM is fast but loses its contents when the computer is turned off.

2. ROM (Read-Only Memory): ROM is a type of non-volatile memory that stores firmware and essential system instructions that do not change. It contains the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and boot loader code required to start the computer. ROM retains its contents even when the computer is turned off.

3. Cache: Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located within the CPU or between the CPU and main memory. It stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing and reduce latency. Cache memory is faster than RAM but smaller in size.

4. Register: Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU used to store data, instructions, and memory addresses during program execution. Registers are the fastest type of memory and are used for temporary storage of operands and results during arithmetic and logical operations.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understand why secondary storage is required.
---------------------------------------------

1) Permanent Data Storage:
Primary purpose: To store data persistently, even when the power is off.
Unlike RAM, which is volatile, secondary storage retains data without constant power.
This allows users to save work, install software, and maintain long-term data archives.


2) Large Capacity:
Secondary storage devices typically offer much larger capacities than primary memory (RAM).
This allows for storage of vast amounts of data, including operating systems, applications, user files, and multimedia content.
As data requirements grow, secondary storage can be easily expanded or upgraded.


3) Cost-Effectiveness:
Per gigabyte, secondary storage is significantly cheaper than RAM or other forms of primary memory.
This makes it economically viable to store large amounts of data that aren't needed for immediate processing.


4) Data Portability:
Many forms of secondary storage (like external hard drives, SSDs, or USB flash drives) are portable.
This allows for easy data transfer between different computers or backup of important information.


5) Backup and Recovery:
Secondary storage is essential for creating backups of critical data.
In case of system failures or data loss, these backups can be used to recover information.


6) Offline Access:
Data stored in secondary storage can be accessed even when the computer is offline.
This is particularly useful for mobile devices or in situations with limited network connectivity.


7) Program and OS Storage:
Secondary storage holds the operating system, applications, and user programs.
This allows the system to reload all necessary software after a reboot or power cycle.


8) Virtual Memory Support:
Secondary storage can be used as an extension of RAM through virtual memory techniques.
This allows the system to run more or larger programs than would fit in physical RAM alone.


9) Data Archiving:
For long-term storage of historical or infrequently accessed data.
Useful for compliance, research, and maintaining organizational knowledge.


10) Scalability:
As data needs grow, secondary storage can be easily expanded without major system changes.
This scalability is crucial for evolving business and personal computing needs.


11) Separation of Storage and Processing:
By keeping data separate from the processing unit, it allows for more flexible system architectures.
This separation also contributes to data safety, as processing errors are less likely to directly corrupt stored data.

Explain the term cloud storage :

Cloud storage refers to a service model where data is stored, managed, and backed up remotely on servers accessed via the internet, rather than on a local device or physical server. Users can upload, access, and share their data from anywhere with an internet connection. 

Key characteristics of cloud storage include: -->
1. Accessibility: Data can be accessed anytime and from any device connected to the internet.
2. Scalability: Storage capacity can be easily scaled up or down according to user needs without additional hardware.
3. Cost-effectiveness: Cloud storage eliminates the need for physical storage devices and reduces maintenance costs.
4. Data Backup and Recovery: Providers often offer automatic backups and disaster recovery options.
5. Security: Data stored in the cloud is protected with encryption and other security measures, though it's important to use trusted providers.

Popular cloud storage services include Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Amazon S3.

Understand the term embedded system and explain how an embedded system differs from a non-embedded system


Embedded System : 

An embedded system is a specialized computing system that performs dedicated functions or tasks within a larger mechanical or electrical system. It is "embedded" as part of the device it controls, often with real-time computing constraints. Embedded systems are designed for specific tasks, unlike general-purpose computers, and are typically optimized for efficiency, speed, and reliability in performing those tasks.

Examples of Embedded Systems:
Smartwatches
Washing machines
ATMs
Automotive control systems (e.g., anti-lock brakes)
Medical devices (e.g., pacemakers)
