# What is Assignment oprator?
# Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.

# x,a,b,c,z

# x = 6
# print(type(x))

# There are 8 assignment operators in Python:

# 1. = (Assignment Operator)
# 2. += (Addition Assignment)
# 3. -= (Subtraction Assignment)
# 4. *= (Multiplication Assignment)
# 5. /= (Division Assignment)
# 6. %= (Modulus Assignment)
# 7. //= (Floor Division Assignment)
# 8. **= (Exponentiation Assignment)

# = (Assignment Operator)

# x = 5
# print(x)

# += (Addition Assignment)

# x = 2
# x += 5
# print(x)

# 3. -= (Subtraction Assignment)

# y = 10
# # y -= 2
# y = y - 2

# print(y)

"""
    x = 10
    y ?

    y = x - 2 
"""

# 4. *= (Multiplication Assignment)

# x = 5
# x *= 2
# x = x * 2

# print(x)

# 5. /= (Division Assignment) Division Assignment is return the float value

# x = 10
# x /= 2
# x = x / 2

# print(x)

# 6. %= (Modulus Assignment)

# x = 10
# x %= 2  
# x = x % 2

# print(x)

# 7. //= (Floor Division Assignment) floor division is retuen the integer value

# x = 10
# x //= 3
# x = x // 3

# print(x)

# 8. **= (Exponentiation Assignment)

x = 2
x **= 3

print(x)
