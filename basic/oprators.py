# Arithmetic Operators

# 1. Addition
# 2. Subtraction
# 3. Multiplication
# 4. Division
# 5. Modulus
# 6. Exponentiation
# 7. Floor Division

# Example 1: Addition


'''a = 10
b = 5
c = a + b
print("Addition is :- ",c)'''

# Example 2: Subtraction

'''x = 5
y = 10
z = x - y

print("Subtraction is :- ",z)'''

# Example 3: Multiplication

'''a = 10
b = 5
c = a * b
print("Multiplication is :- ",c)'''

# Example 4: Division

# c = 10
# d = 5
# e = c / d
# print("Division is :- ",e)

# Example 5: Modulus

'''a = 10
b = 5
c = a % b
print("Modulus is :- ",c)'''

# Example 6: Exponentiation  

# What is Exponentiation?
# Exponentiation is the raising of one number to the power of another number.

# how to calculate Exponentiation in python?
# In python, we use the ** operator to calculate the Exponentiation.

# it like a square of a number
# it will conunt the power of a number

'''a = 2
b = 3
c = a ** b
print("Exponentiation is :- ",c)'''

# Example 7: Floor Division

# What is Floor Division?
# Floor Division is the division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed.

# a = 10
# b = 3

# c = a // b
# print("Floor Division is :- ",c)


# example of Exponentiation

"""a = 5
b = 2
c = a ** b
print("Exponentiation is :- ",c)"""
