# what is Relational oprators in python?
# Relational operators are used to compare two values.

# There are 6 relational operators in Python:

# 1. Less than (<)
# 2. Less than or equal to (<=)
# 3. Greater than (>)
# 4. Greater than or equal to (>=)
# 5. Equal to (==)
# 6. Not equal to (!=)


# what is the difference between == and = ?
# = is an assignment operator
# x = 5

# == is a relational operator
# 5 == 5: to comper two values

# Example 1: Less than (<)

# a = 10
# b = 5

# if a < b:
#     print("a is less than b")
# else:
#     print("a is not less than b")

# Example 2: Less than or equal to (<=)

# a = 10
# b = 10

# if a <= b:
#     print("a is less than b")
# else:
#     print("a is not less than b")

# Example 3: Greater than (>)

# a = 10
# b = 5

# if a > b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#     print("a is not greater than b")

# Example 4: Greater than or equal to (>=)

# a = 10
# b = 10

# if a >= b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#     print("a is not greater than b")


# Example 5: Equal to (==)

# a = 10
# b = 1

# if a == b:
#     print("a is equal to b")
# else:
#     print("a is not equal to b")

# Example 6: Not equal to (!=)

# a = 10
# b = 5

# if a != b:
#     print("a and b are not equal")
# else:
#     print("a and b are equal")
