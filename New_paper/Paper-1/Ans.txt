1. Define the term algorithm

--> An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem. It takes input, processes it, and produces an output in a finite amount of time.


1.2 

       x <- LEN(state)

       Length of the state is stored in x 
       California -> it has 10 characters so 

       x = 10  (option : C)


1.3

what is the meaning of concatenating ?
-> Concatenating is the process of combining two or more strings or sequences of characters into a single string or sequence.

Example :

x1 => "Hello"
x2 => "World"

option : D


1.4

Looking at the problem, we need to understand how SUBSTRING works:

SUBSTRING(start_position, length, 'string')
It extracts characters from the given string based on start position and length


In the example shown:
SUBSTRING(4, 7, 'landmark')

Start position = 4
Length = 7
String = "landmark"


Let's count positions in "landmark":
l a n d m a r k
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Starting from position 4 ("d") and taking 7 characters:
"dmark"
Looking at the given options:
A) Alca
B) Atra
C) land
D) traz
The answer matches option D: "traz"
