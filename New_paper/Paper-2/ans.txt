Question 7-(A):

The term "pixel" refers to the smallest unit of a digital image or display that can be individually controlled or represented. It is short for "Picture Element" and acts as a single point in a graphical image or on a digital screen.


Question 7-(B):

Divide into pixels : Each squre in the grid corresponds to one pixel in the image. since the grid is 5x5 , there are 25 pixels.

Assign the colors : the color depth of 2 bits allows for 4 possible color 
Ex : 00 - white color
     01 - light gray 
     11 - black 

Each pixel is assign a 2 bit value based on its color

for the first row : 00, 00, 00, 00, 11
for the second row : 00, 01, 01, 11, 11
for the third row : 00, 01, 01, 11, 11
for the fourth row : 00, 11, 11, 11, 11
for the fifth row : 11, 11, 11, 11, 11


Bitmap Representation: This sequence of 2-bit values is combined into a data structure that represents the entire image.
