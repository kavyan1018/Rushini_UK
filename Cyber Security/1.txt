Cyber Security
----------------------------------
Definition:
Cyber security involves processes, practices, and technologies designed to protect networks, computers, programs, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage.

Main Purposes:

1.To safeguard sensitive information.
2.To ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data.
3.To prevent cyber attacks, such as malware, phishing, and unauthorized access.


Cyber Security Threats
-------------------------------------
Common Threats:

1) Social Engineering Techniques: Manipulating individuals to disclose confidential information.

    -> Blagging (Pretexting): Using an invented scenario to trick individuals into sharing private data.
    -> Phishing: Fraudulently obtaining information through deceptive emails or messages.
    -> Shouldering: Observing sensitive information over someone's shoulder (e.g., PIN numbers at ATMs).

2) Malicious Code (Malware): Hostile software designed to damage or disrupt systems.
    ->  Computer Virus: Infects and spreads through files or systems.
    ->  Trojan: Disguises itself as legitimate software while causing harm.
    ->  Spyware: Secretly gathers user information.

3) Pharming: Redirecting traffic from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones.

4) Weak and Default Passwords: Easily guessable passwords that provide unauthorized access.

5) Misconfigured Access Rights: Granting incorrect or excessive privileges.

6) Removable Media: Portable devices (e.g., USBs) introducing malware into systems.

7) Unpatched or Outdated Software: Vulnerabilities in outdated systems exploited by attackers.


Penetration Testing
-----------------------------
Definition:
A process of simulating cyber attacks to identify and address security weaknesses.

Types:-
1) Internal Testing: Simulates an attack from within the organization, often using credentials.
2) External Testing: Simulates an attack from outside the organization without prior knowledge of the system.


Detection and Prevention of Cyber Security Threats
----------------------------------------------------------
Methods:
1) Biometric Measures: Use of fingerprints, facial recognition, etc., particularly on mobile devices.
2) Password Systems: Implementing strong and unique passwords.
3) CAPTCHA: Preventing automated attacks by verifying human interaction.
4) Email Confirmations: Verifying user identity via confirmation emails.
5) Automatic Software Updates: Ensuring systems are patched against known vulnerabilities.
