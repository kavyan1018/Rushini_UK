Let’s dive deeper into specific areas!

Detailed Examples and Concepts
--------------------------------------------
1. Subroutines with Multiple Parameters
When a subroutine requires more than one parameter, it allows for more flexible operations. Here's an extended example:

Task: Create a program to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle.

# ```python
# def calculate_perimeter(length, width):
#     """Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle."""
#     return 2 * (length + width)
# 
# def calculate_area(length, width):
#     """Calculate the area of a rectangle."""
#     return length * width
# 
# def main():
#     """Main procedure to input dimensions and display results."""
#     length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
#     width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
#     
#     # Call subroutines with parameters
#     perimeter = calculate_perimeter(length, width)
#     area = calculate_area(length, width)
#     
#     print(f"Perimeter: {perimeter}")
#     print(f"Area: {area}")
# 
# # Run the program
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
# ```


2. Parameters and Return Values
--------------------------------------------
Parameters allow data to flow into a subroutine, while return values allow data to flow **out**.

Task: Create a subroutine to check if a number is prime and return the result.

#```python
#def is_prime(number):
#    """Check if a number is prime."""
#    if number <= 1:
#        return False
#    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
#        if number % i == 0:
#            return False
#    return True
#
## Call and use the return value
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#if is_prime(num):
#    print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
#else:
#    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
#```

3. Local Variables in Subroutines
-----------------------------------------
Local variables are accessible only within the subroutine where they are defined.

Why Use Local Variables?
- Avoids conflicts with variables in other parts of the program.
- Limits the scope of variables for better control.

Example:

# ```python
# def calculate_discount(price, discount_rate):
#     """Calculate the discounted price."""
#     discounted_price = price - (price * discount_rate / 100)  # Local variable
#     return discounted_price
# 
# # Variables outside the subroutine won't conflict with `discounted_price`
# price = 500
# discount_rate = 10
# final_price = calculate_discount(price, discount_rate)
# print(f"Final Price: {final_price}")
# ```

4. Structured Programming in Action
---------------------------------------------
Let’s build a simple quiz program that uses subroutines for modularization.

Task: A quiz program with structured design.

# ```python
# def ask_question(question, correct_answer):
#     """Ask a question and return True if the answer is correct."""
#     answer = input(question + " ")
#     return answer.lower() == correct_answer.lower()
# 
# def calculate_score(results):
#     """Calculate the total score from the results."""
#     return sum(results)
# 
# def main():
#     """Main procedure to run the quiz."""
#     print("Welcome to the Quiz!")
#     questions = [
#         ("What is the capital of France?", "Paris"),
#         ("What is 5 + 7?", "12"),
#         ("What programming language is this?", "Python")
#     ]
#     
#     results = []
#     for question, correct_answer in questions:
#         results.append(ask_question(question, correct_answer))
#     
#     score = calculate_score(results)
#     print(f"You got {score}/{len(questions)} questions correct!")
# 
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
# ```

5. Advantages of Structured Programming
--------------------------------------------
Scenario: Imagine building a calculator program without subroutines. The code would be repetitive, harder to debug, and difficult to modify. By using structured programming:
- Operations like addition, subtraction, etc., are encapsulated in reusable subroutines.
- Variables and logic are modularized for clarity.
